Transfer list
=============

The TL is composed of a TL header which is followed by sequence of Transfer
Entries (TE). The whole TL is contiguous in physical address space. The TL
header and all the TEs are 8-byte aligned (we use `align8()` to denote this).
The TL header specifies the number of bytes occupied by the
TL. The TEs are defined in :numref:`sec_tl_entry_hdr` and
:numref:`sec_std_entries`. Each TE carries a header which contains an
identifier, `tag_id`, that is used to determine the content of the associated
TE. The TL header is located at `tl_base_pa`. The `tl_base_pa` is passed in the
register allocated for that handoff boundary (as specified in
:numref:`handoff_arch_bindings`). A
depiction of the TL is present in :numref:`fig_list` , there the first TE in
the list (TE[0]) is shown to start at the end of the TL header
(`tl_base_pa + 8`). The second TE in the list (TE[1]) starts at the next multiple
of 8, after the end of the TE[0].

Transfer list requirements
--------------------------

**R1:** The tl_base_pa address must be at a 8-byte boundary.

**R2:** All fields defined in this specification must be stored in memory with little-endian byte order.

**R3:** The base address of a TE must be the 8-byte aligned address immediately after the end of the previous entry (or TL header, if the TE is the first entry on the TL).

**R4:** When relocating the TL, the offset from `tl_base_pa` to the nearest alignment boundary specified by the `alignment` field in the TL header must be preserved.


Transfer list header
--------------------

A TL must begin with a TL header. The layout of the TL header is shown in
:numref:`tab_tl_header`.  The presence of a TL header can be verified by
inspecting the signature field which must contain the 0x6e_d0ff value.  The
version field determines the contents of the handoff start header. The version
will only be changed by an update to this specification when new TL header or
TE header fields are defined (i.e. not when allocating new tag IDs), and all
changes will be backwards-compatible to older readers.

.. _tab_tl_header:
.. list-table:: TL header
   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - signature
     - 0x4
     - 0x0
     - The value of signature must be `0x6e_d0ff`.

   * - checksum
     - 0x1
     - 0x4
     - The checksum is used to ensure the data contained within the list is intact. The checksum is set to a value such that the sum over every byte in the {`tl_base_pa`, â€¦, `tl_base_pa + size - 1`} address range, modulo 256, is equal to 0. For the purposes of this calculation, the value of this checksum field in the TL header must be assumed as 0. Note that the checksum includes the TL header, all TEs and the inter-TE padding, but not the range reserved for future TE additions up to max_size. The values of inter-TE padding bytes are not defined by this specification and may be uninitialized memory. (This means that multiple TLs with exactly the same size and contents may still have different checksum values.)

   * - version
     - 0x1
     - 0x5
     - The version of the TL header. This field is set to 1 for the TL header layout described in this version of the table. Code that encounters a TL with a version higher than it knows to support may still read the TL and all its TEs, and assume that it is backwards-compatible to previous versions (ignoring any extra bytes in a potentially larger TL or TE header). However, code may not append new entries to a TL unless it knows how to append entries for the specified version.

   * - hdr_size
     - 0x1
     - 0x6
     - The size of this TL header in bytes. This field is set to 16 for the TL header layout described in this version of the table.

   * - alignment
     - 0x1
     - 0x7
     - The maximum alignment required by any TE in the TL, specified as a power of two. For a newly created TL, the alignment requirement is 8 so this value should be set to 3. It should be updated whenever a new TE is added with a larger requirement than the current value.

   * - size
     - 0x4
     - 0x8
     - The number of bytes occupied by the TL. This field accounts for the size of the TL header plus the size of all the entries contained in the TL. It must be a multiple of 8 (i.e. it includes the inter-TE padding after the end of the last TE). This field must be updated when any entry is added to the TL.

   * - max_size
     - 0x4
     - 0xc
     - The maximum number of bytes that the TL can occupy. Any entry producer must check if there is sufficient space before adding an entry to the list. Firmware can resize and/or relocate the TL and update this field accordingly, provided that the TL requirements are respected. This field must be a multiple of 8.


.. _sec_tl_entry_hdr:

TL entry header
---------------

All TEs start with an entry header followed by a data section.

Note: the size of an entry (hdr_size + data_size) is not mandatorily an 8-byte
multiple. When traversing the TL firmware must compute the next TE address following
R3.

For example, assume the current TE is `te` and its address is `te_base_addr`.  Using
C language notation, a derivation of the base address of the next TE
(next_base_addr) is the following:

.. code-block:: C

   next_base_addr = align8(te_base_addr + te.hdr_size + te.data_size)

The TE header is defined in :numref:`tab_te_header`.

.. _tab_te_header:

.. list-table:: TE header
   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - tag_id
     - 0x3
     - 0x0
     - The entry type identifier.

   * - hdr_size
     - 0x1
     - 0x3
     - The size of this entry header in bytes. This field is set to 8 for the TE header layout described in this version of the table.

   * - data_size
     - 0x4
     - 0x4
     - The exact size of the data content in bytes, not including inter-TE padding. May be 0.


Entry type ranges
-----------------

The content of the data section is determined by the tag id. The tag id space contains two ranges:

 #. Standard range, and
 #. Non-standard range

The `tag_id` ranges are described in :numref:`tab_tag_id_ranges`.

.. _tab_tag_id_ranges:

.. list-table:: Tag ID ranges
   :widths: 3 8

   * - tag ID range
     - Description

   * - 0x0 -- 0xf_ffff
     - Standard tag id range. Any tag id in this range must first be allocated in this specification before being used. The allocation of the tag id requires the entry layout to be defined as well.


   * - 0x10_0000 -- 0x10_ffff
     - Non-standard range. A platform firmware integrator can create entries in this range. Different platforms are allowed to have tag ids in this range with distinct data formats. Entries in this range are not standardized.

   * - 0x11_0000 -- 0xffff_ffff
     - Reserved

.. _sec_std_entries:

Standard transfer entries
-------------------------

The TEs have a `tag_id` in the {0, ..., 0xf_ffff} set. Both
the tag_id of a standard entry as well as the entry layout
must be defined in this specification before being used.
New entries are expected to have a simple layout. Complex
data should be represented in a self-describing data
structure, such as the FDT [DT]_.

The following entry types are currently defined:

- empty entry: tag_id = 0  (:numref:`void_entry`).
- fdt entry: tag_id = 1  (:numref:`fdt_entry`).
- single HOB block entry: tag_id = 2 (:numref:`hob_block_entry`).
- HOB list entry: tag_id = 3 (:numref:`hob_list_entry`).
- ACPI table aggregate entry: tag_id = 4 (:numref:`acpi_aggr_entry`).

All other standard `tag_id` values are reserved by this specification.

.. _void_entry:

Empty entry layout (XFERLIST_VOID)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The empty or void entry should not contain any information to be consumed by any firmware stage.
The intent of the void entry type is to remove information from the list without needing to
relocate subsequent entries, or to create padding for entries that require a specific alignment.
Void entries may be freely overwritten with new TEs, provided the resulting TL remains valid
(i.e. a void entry can only be overwritten by a TE of equal or smaller size; if the size is more
than 8 bytes smaller, a new void entry must be created behind the new TE to cover the remaining
space up to the next TE).

.. _tab_void:

   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - tag_id
     - 0x3
     - 0x0
     - The tag_id field must be set to **0**.

   * - hdr_size

     - 0x3
     - |hdr_size_desc|

   * - data_size
     - 0x4
     - 0x4
     - The size of the void space in bytes. May be 0. For XFERLIST_VOID,
     data_size *MUST* be a multiple of 8 (i.e. there must be no space left to
     inter-TE padding after this TE).

   * - void_data
     - data_size
     - hdr_size
     - Void content


.. _fdt_entry:

FDT entry layout (XFERLIST_FDT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fdt is defined in [DT]_. The FDT TE contains the fdt in the data section.
The intent of the FDT entry is to carry the hardware description devicetree in
the flattened devicetree (FDT) [DT]_ representation.

.. _tab_fdt:
.. list-table:: FDT type layout
   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - tag_id
     - 0x3
     - 0x0
     - The tag_id field must be set to **1**.

   * - hdr_size
     - 0x1
     - 0x3
     - |hdr_size_desc|

   * - data_size
     - 0x4
     - 0x4
     - The size of the FDT in bytes.

   * - fdt
     - data_size
     - hdr_size
     - The fdt field contains the hardware description fdt.


.. _hob_block_entry:

HOB block entry layout (XFERLIST_HOB_B)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HOB is defined in [PI]_. This entry type encapsulates a single HOB block.
The intent of the HOB block entry is to hold a single HOB block. A complete HOB
list can then be constructed, by a receiver, by obtaining all the HOB blocks in
the TL and following the HOB list requirements defined in [PI]_.

.. _tab_hob_block:
.. list-table:: HOB block type layout
   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - tag_id
     - 0x3
     - 0x0
     - The tag_id field must be set to **2**.

   * - hdr_size
     - 0x1
     - 0x3
     - |hdr_size_desc|

   * - data_size
     - 0x4
     - 0x4
     - The size of the HOB block in bytes.

   * - hob_block
     - data_size
     - hdr_size
     - Holds a single HOB block.


.. _hob_list_entry:

HOB list entry layout (XFERLIST_HOB_L)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HOB list is defined in [PI]_. The HOB list starts with a PHIT block and can
contain an arbitrary number of HOB blocks. This entry type encapsulates a
complete HOB list.  An enclosed HOB list must respect the HOB list constraints
specified in [PI]_.

.. _tab_hob_list:
.. list-table:: HOB list type layout
   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - tag_id
     - 0x3
     - 0x0
     - The tag_id field must be set to **3**.

     - 0x3
     - |hdr_size_desc|

   * - data_size
     - 0x4
     - 0x4
     - The size of the HOB list in bytes.

   * - hob_list
     - data_size
     - hdr_size
     - Holds a complete HOB list.


.. _acpi_aggr_entry:

ACPI table aggregate entry layout (XFERLIST_ACPI_AGGR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This entry type holds one or more ACPI tables. The first table must start at
offset `hdr_size` from the start of the entry. Since ACPI tables usually have an
alignment requirement larger than 8, writers may first need to create an
XFERLIST_VOID padding entry so that the subsequent `te_base_addr + te.hdr_size`
will be correctly aligned. Any subsequent ACPI tables must be located at the
next 16-byte alligned address following the preceding ACPI table. Note that each
ACPI table has a `Length` field in the ACPI table header [ACPI]_, which must be
used to determine the end of the ACPI table.  The `data_size` value must be set
such that the last ACPI table in this entry ends at offset
`hdr_size + data_size` from the start of the entry.

.. _tab_acpi_aggr:
.. list-table:: ACPI table aggregate type layout
   :widths: 2 2 2 8

   * - Field
     - Size (bytes)
     - Offset (bytes)
     - Description

   * - tag_id
     - 0x3
     - 0x0
     - The tag_id field must be set to **4**.
