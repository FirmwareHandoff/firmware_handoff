Anyone may contribute to the FirmwareHandoff project. Contributions are

To help track the origin of contributions, this project uses the same DCO
"sign-off" process as used by the Linux kernel. The sign-off is a simple line,
at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it
or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
Any contribution must contain the sign-off line at the end of the explanation in every patch message.
The following is an example of a sign-off line::

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
